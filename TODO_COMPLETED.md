# Eisenhower Matrix Todo App - Development Status

## Overview âœ… COMPLETED
Create a functional todo app that allows users to input tasks, assign priorities based on the Eisenhower Matrix principles (Urgent/Important), and automatically rank tasks. The app should display a visual Eisenhower Matrix showing task distribution.
