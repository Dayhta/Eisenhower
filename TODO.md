# Eisenhower Matrix Todo App Development

## Overview
Create a functional todo app that allows users to input tasks, assign priorities based on the Eisenhower Matrix principles (Urgent/Important), and automatically rank tasks. The app should display a visual Eisenhower Matrix showing task distribution.

## Development Tasks

### Backend Development
- [x] Set up database models for tasks
  - [x] Create Task model with fields: title, description, urgency, importance, created_at, updated_at
  - [x] Add database connection and setup
- [x] Implement CRUD API endpoints
  - [x] POST /tasks - Create new task
  - [x] GET /tasks - List all tasks with ranking
  - [x] PUT /tasks/{id} - Update task
  - [x] DELETE /tasks/{id} - Delete task
- [x] Add task prioritization logic
  - [x] Implement scoring algorithm based on urgency/importance
  - [x] Create automatic ranking system

### Frontend Development
- [x] Create task input form
  - [x] Task title and description fields
  - [x] Urgency scale input (1-10)
  - [x] Importance scale input (1-10)
  - [x] Form validation
- [x] Implement task list display
  - [x] Show tasks ranked by priority score
  - [x] Display urgency and importance values
  - [x] Add edit/delete functionality
- [x] Build Eisenhower Matrix visualization
  - [x] Create 2x2 grid layout
  - [x] Position tasks based on urgency/importance
  - [x] Make it interactive (click to view task details)
  - [x] Color coding for different quadrants

### Integration & Polish
- [x] Connect frontend to backend API
- [x] Add responsive design
- [x] Implement error handling
- [x] Add loading states
- [ ] Test the complete workflow

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Update Docker configuration
- [ ] Test in different environments
- [ ] Update README with usage instructions

## Current Status
- [x] Basic project structure created
- [x] Docker setup configured
- [x] Backend API endpoints
- [x] Frontend components
- [x] Task prioritization logic
- [x] Visual matrix display

## Next Steps
1. Test the application end-to-end
2. Fix any bugs found during testing
3. Update Docker configuration for the new dependencies
4. Update README with usage instructions
